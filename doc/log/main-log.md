## Achievements
- Remove handler: computation is pure for handler
- Remove handler: bind: outer bind is pure for handler
- Split-handler for bind: (inner bind is pure) specialization
- Split-handler for bind: generalization
- Handle LetRec optimization
- Fix bug: pure_beta_reduce
- Add testing script for optimizations
- Benchmark script: Interpreter
