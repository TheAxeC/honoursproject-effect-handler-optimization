## ICFP Paper: Efficient Compilation of Algebraic Effects and Handlers
I have begun writing the ICFP paper that is currently called: Efficient Compilation of Algebraic Effects and Handlers.
This week I spend my time working on the rewrite-rules.

## Write benchmark programs: parser
Wrote a first version of the parser. It consumes characters and computes a numerical result.

The optimization does not happen correctly yet.
